# bayesian-optimisation-hyperparameter-tuning

In this project, we will use the Boston Housing dataset, a popular dataset for regression problems. The Boston Housing dataset contains information about the housing values in the suburbs of Boston. There are 506 samples and 13 feature variables in this dataset. Our objective is to predict the value of houses in the suburbs of Boston based on these features.

The task will be accomplished in two major steps. First, we will use a simple neural network (NN) model for prediction, which will help us understand the performance of a baseline model on this dataset. Then, we will use Bayesian optimisation (BO) to search for the optimal hyperparameters of the NN model to improve its performance. We will also create the **Parallelised Bayesian Optimization** process for efficient hyperparameter tuning.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use machine learning tools in Python for model training and hyperparameter optimisation. The libraries we'll use include TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, and GPyOpt.
